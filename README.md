#### Example Usage
How to set a custom sleep screen for a specific book
- Configure your sleep screen preferences
- Under Screen 🞂 Sleep Screen 🞂 Sleep screen presets 🞂 select "Create new preset from current settings" or long press an existing preset to update or rename it.
- Under the Tools menu 🞂 Profiles 🞂 New
- Enable Auto-execute
  - on book opening
  - if book metadata contains
  - title
  - current book
  - Save
- Edit actions
  - Screen and lights
  - Load screensaver preset
  - Select your preset

Default book sleep screen
- Repeat the same steps as above, except select "always" for "on book opening"
- You may need to set this up before specific book, author, etc. profiles. Or specific metadata triggers may always take precedence over "always". I'm not 100% sure how the order of execution is determined.

### [2-profile-actions](2-profile-actions.lua)
Adds new actions that can be triggered by the Profiles plugin.
In the future may add new events to trigger profile auto-execute.
#### New Actions
- General 🞂 Set starts with location
  - Sets the start location after a restart (not wake from sleep).
  - Use case: Set to last file when opening a book and set to file browser when opening the file browser. This way, you always return where you last were after a restart instead of automatically opening the last file even if you were finished with it.
#### New Auto-execute Events
- None
